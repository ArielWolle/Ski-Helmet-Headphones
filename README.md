# Ski-Helmet-Headphones
Putting Bluetooth headphones within my ski helmet

THE IDEA

While skiing I like to listen to music. Usually, I would just put earbuds under my helmet, but this can lead to them falling out or pain from the added pressure. Therefore, I decided to incorporate headphones directly into my ski helmet.

PROJECT GOALS

For this project,  I wanted to hear music through my helmet in the most seamless way possible. I also wanted to incorporate Bluetooth into the device.

MATERIALS

Starting off this project I knew that I would need  4 basic items: Speakers, speaker wires, a Bluetooth receiver, and a battery. I also wanted to keep this project relatively cheap at about $30 not including the price of the helmet or batteries.

FIRST STEPS

The first thing I did in this project was take apart my sisters $5 headphones in order to see how cheap headphones work. These headphones had 2 inexpensive drivers connected directly to R/L positive/data (respectively) and a common ground.  From this, I figured I could just buy 2 headphone drivers and connect them directly to a 3.5mm headphone jack wire. Off of Amazon, I bought a set of headphone speaker drivers (link 1), and a Bluetooth module for Arduinos (link 2), both for a total of $33.18. This was a little overbudget but still doable.

THE FIRST MISTAKES

My first mistake was the Bluetooth module I bought. This module could be run off of a standard phone battery bank, but no combination would fit seamlessly (a design goal). I later changed to an integrated Bluetooth receiver + LiPo battery (link 3).  This brought the total cost to $33.98, as I had returned the old Bluetooth module. This was a slightly greater cost than before but this Bluetooth module included a battery.

BUILDING THE PROJECT

Once all the necessary components arrived, I did testing on both the speakers and Bluetooth receiver to check if they worked.  After this preliminary step,  I started taking measurements of each component. The speakers needed a housing to prevent damage and they had to fit seamlessly in the helmetâ€™s limited capacity. I then designed and 3D printed my own speaker housings with holes for wires to exit from. These housings used a interference fit that had to be hit into place to lock the pieces together. (File 1)

After this step,  I soldered on each wire for the speakers and connected everything for testing. Everything worked as planned and I proceed to test the fitment inside the helmet. The speakers and receiver all fit well and were even sleeker than I had estimated.

PROJECT TAKEAWAYS AND LESSONS

This project was a nice and simple helmet modification that took < 3 hours of design, concept, and building time, as well as being better than I had initially imagined. During this project I learned about how speaker drivers function, sharpened my soldering skills, and lastly gained more experience in making functional 3D prints. Overall, I am very happy with this project and would recommend it to anyone with a couple hours and a 3D printer.

PROJECT NEXT STEPS

I could improve this project by adding a USB-C wire for charging that hangs out of the helmet so the receiver does not need to be removed every night. As well as this, I would buy a bigger LiPo battery to get more life out of the receiver.
